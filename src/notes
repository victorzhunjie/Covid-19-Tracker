Why BEM
BEM naming provides three specific benefits:

It communicates purpose or function
It communicates component structure
It sets a consistent low-level of specificity for styling selectors
How It Works
A BEM class name includes up to three parts.

Block: The outermost parent element of the component is defined as the block.
Element: Inside of the component may be one or more children called elements.
Modifier: Either a block or element may have a variation signified by a modifier.
If all three are used in a name it would look something like this:

[block]__[element]--[modifier]
